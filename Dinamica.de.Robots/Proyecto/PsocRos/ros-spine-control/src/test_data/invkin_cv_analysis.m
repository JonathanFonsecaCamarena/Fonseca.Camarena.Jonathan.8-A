% Combination of tests on 2018-12-13. Here's what was going on:
% Somehow, we introduced an offset error since the good test on the 12th.
% Since all we needed anyway was a timestep correlation, and since the
% inverse kinematics inputs/states are always the same, we did the
% following:
% 1) Took the timestamps from -10 rows since the first response of the
% sweep test from the correlated test
% 2) Plugged them into the older test data
% 3) Run the analysis with the "new" state timestamps and "old" data. This
% is actually OK, modulo some potential millisec errors in the response,
% since the "new" state timestamps are the same frequency as the "old".
% There's just potentiall a small offset.
