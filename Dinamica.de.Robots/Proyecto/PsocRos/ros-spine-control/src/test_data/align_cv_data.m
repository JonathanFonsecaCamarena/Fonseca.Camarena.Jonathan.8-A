%align_cv_data Outputs an array of the computer vision data for the 2D
% spine test, according to the start time and dt.
%   
%   Inputs:
%
%       timestamps = n x 1 array of millisecond timestamps for the data.
%       data = n x m array of the data that should be selected out.
%       starttime = integer greater than min(timestamps) from which to
%           start counting
%       dt = time between indices to select.
%
%   Outputs:
%       aligned timestamps, data = starting at starttime, closest to dt
%           (just after each dt)

% Pick out some constants
n = size(timestamps, 1);

% We'll be counting continuously since starttime.

% since end time depends on the data array.
% Take the first datapoint in each case.

% That occurs when currindex > n.
