INSTALL instructions for ros-spine-control workspace and spine-controller package:

Requirements:
	Ubuntu 18.04
	ROS Melodic desktop. see http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu. Unsure if full required vs. plain desktop.
	pyserial, for python 2.7. (Can be done via Ubuntu libraries, sudo apt-get install python-serial, NOT python3-serial.)
	OpenCV, with contrib, for python 2.7. This is NOT possible from just the Ubuntu repos. Here's how to do it:
		Remove any pip installed versions of OpenCV, they probably are for python 3. Example: if you have something in python3.7/dist-packages/cv2.
		Note that ros-melodic-desktop's package will *not* work, even though it's python 2.7, it does not include opencv-contrib.
		Suggestion is to use pip, specifying python 2.7 (to-do: write how to do this). Package is opencv-contrib-python.
		(Jacob: fix this ^ if not exactly correct)
	User access to the serial port. Under Ubuntu, usually /dev/ttyACM0. To do so, your user needs to be part of the 'dialout' group. Example: run...
		>> sudo adduser $USER dialout

Using:
	Standard ros procedure. Source devel/setup.bash, then see the individual files for suggestions on how to run the scripts.
