 * uart_helper_fcns.h
 * A collection of helper functions for the UART communication,
 * when interrupt-driven (for multitasking.)
 * 
 * How do I use these functions?
 * Write #include "uart_helper_fcns.h" at the top of your main.c file,
 * and you'll be able to call every function here.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: this assumes you'll use the interrupt handler below, Interrupt_Handler_UART_Receive.
